                with a home computer and a GPU can start to mine crypto currency. Nvidia or AMD cards can be used, but
                we prefer Nvidia cards. We will show you how to use wallets
                and exchanges for trading and cashing out to USD, how to build a mining "rig", and how to use the
                software to mine.

            <h1 class="display-6">Can you mine Bitcoin with a home computer?</h1>



            <p class="lead">Technically, yes you can. Is it worth it? No. The days of mining bitcoin with a home
                computer's CPU or GPU are long gone due to the massive difficulty increase and network difficulty. These
                days you need special hardware called ASICs to mine Bitcoin directly. ASICs are very expensive, very
                loud, produce a lot more heat, and use a lot more electricity. ASICs are typically not geared towards a
                home mining operation.
            <p>
                As the price of Bitcoin rose from mere pennies in 2010 to a high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017, so
                too has the mining difficulty with many people jumping on board. Nowadays, the general practice is
                to mine alt-coins and exchange them for bitcoin. Bitcoin has the highest market cap, and is the most
                sought after coin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plenty of new GPU miners who are just starting out typically can point their mining
                rig
                to <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/" add target="_blank">Nicehash</a> which will use an
                algorithm to mine the most profitable
                alt-coin on their platform and automatically exchange it for Bitcoin. At the time of this writing
                --August 2020, the minimum payout on Nicehash
                was 0.001 BTC with free transfers if you have a coinbase account linked. At the time of this writing a
                6-8 card current gen Nvidia rig can get you a payout almost daily. A typical gaming desktop with a
                midlevel GPU (2060/2070) might get a payment every 5 days.
                Once you get experience with mining, recieving payouts, exchanging or transfering it, and cashing out to
                USD and to your bank account, some miners move on to mine the coins directly and hold "bags" of
                speculative project coins, or exchange to Bitcoin if it's available.
                Many people say that you can make a lot more mining coins directly. However it is up to you to calculate
                the risk/reward. With Nicehash, it is simple one click and you autoexchange to bitcoin. Once you start
                mining alt-coins you have to get a wallet for the coin, make sure it's on an exchange, and pay the fees
                to exchange it.</p>
            <p>
                Part of the game sometimes is to get in early on a newly released coin, and accumulate a bunch of it at
                low difficulty and low price, and hold on to it in hopes of a future price increase. This is called
                speculative mining and involves constant research, follow up, and luck.
                But remember, all the coins on the top 25 list that are worth something, were at one time worth very
                little, in some cases less than a penny. (Bitcoin is divisable by 8 after the decimal). Back in
                Bitcoin's early days (~2010), you could use a home computer's CPU and make hundred's of bitcoin a day.
                It was worth pennies then, but if you had held until December 2017, bitcoin's all-time-high was nearly
                $20,000.
                If you had accumulated 1,000 Bitcoins, at all-time-high price you are looking at $20,000,000 (million).

            <h1 class="display-6">Is GPU Mining Profitable?</h1>
            <p class="lead">This depends on a lot of different factors, but the biggest one is your electric cost. A
                popular site <a href="https://whattomine.com/" add target="_blank">whattomine.com</a>, let's you input
                the amount and type
                of GPUs that you own and your electricity cost and shows your profit after electricity cost.
            <p>
                Remember,
                this does not factor in the cost of the hardware.
                The short answer, is this is not a get rich quick process. You will invest in the hardware, electricity
                cost, and time to maintain and look for profitable coins. A lot of times, especially with the top 25
                coins, it is much easier to just buy the coins if you just want some skin in the game.
                Most GPU miners I have met, either enjoy tinkering around with hardware, or are mining a very new coin
                you cannot buy and taking a chance it will be worth more in the future, or they have access to very
                cheap electricty (solar, dorms, low cost area etc...) If you are thinking you are going to buy a few
                computers and GPU's, put them together, and press start and you will start printing out money, that is
                not how it works.
                Just like anything else you invest in, evaluate your cost and tolerance to risk. Can you put a PC
                together and troubleshoot software and hardware?
                Are you willing to spend the time researching a new coin project and creating a new wallet for every new
                coin, and signing
                up for a new exchange?
                Are you financially able to afford the parts, and the electricity cost, out of pocket?
                Do you have already have a gaming desktop PC with one or two GPU's that you just want to mine a few
                hours a day and slowly accumulate something like Ethereum for long term hold?
            </p>
            <p>
                The way I have looked at is, is people spend their disposable income on hobbies like cars, clothing,
                shoes, gadgets etc... that have zero potential of having a Return On Investment (ROI). That Luxury car
                or Iphone will never sell for more than you paid for it, in fact it will be worth much less as time
                passes. The GPUs that you purchase have the potential to give you a Return on Investment, and not to
                mention they are highly sought after parts for PC Gamers. Do a google search on GPU shortages during
                cryptocurrency bull runs (price increases).
            </p>
            <p>
                Bottom line, GPU mining CAN be profitable, depending on your investment of time and money, as well as
                your electricity cost. It can also be very expensive as well. Typical GPUs cost between $300 to $1,200
                each. A
                rig typically has 6 GPUs, you do the math. Are you willing to invest that kind of money with no
                guarantee that you will make a profit?
